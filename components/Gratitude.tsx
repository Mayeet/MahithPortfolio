                I&apos;m incredibly grateful for the support of my family, friends, teachers, and professors
                who&apos;ve shaped me through every stage. One of the biggest lessons I&apos;ve learned is
                that every experience contributes to who I&apos;m becoming, whether good or bad. I&apos;ve
                come to truly value the people who go the extra mile for me, and I&apos;m excited for the
                road ahead and the new experiences that will continue to shape my journey.
